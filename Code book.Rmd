## Overview

This data contains measurements from the accelerometer and gyroscope of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. The data was collected from 30 subjects performing 6 activities. The aim was to create a tidy data set with the average of each mean and standard deviation measurement for each activity and subject.

## Files

- **FinalData.txt** — the output file, with averages by subject and activity.  
- **run_analysis.R** — performs data loading, cleaning, and creation of the tidy data set.

## Variables in FinalData.txt

| Variable Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Subject      | Identifies the participant |
| Code         | Numeric code for activity |
| Activity     | Descriptive activity name |
| Other columns| Average of sensor measurements on mean and standard deviation. These include accelerometer and gyroscope signals measured in time and frequency domains along x, y, and z axes (e.g., TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanX). |

## Data Processing and Cleaning Steps

1. Merged the training and test data sets into one data set.  
2. Extracted only columns containing mean and standard deviation measurements.  
3. Merged descriptive activity names with the numeric activity codes.  
4. Labeled the data set with descriptive variable names by replacing abbreviations and correcting typos.  
5. Created a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  
6. Saved the final tidy data set as "FinalData.txt".
