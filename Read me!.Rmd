# Course Project

This project uses smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data to create a tidy dataset. The aim is to summarize the average of each mean and standard deviation measurement for each subject and activity.

## Files included

-   `run_analysis.R` — script that downloads, cleans, and processes the data\
-   `FinalData.txt` — tidy data set output by the script\
-   `CodeBook.md` — describes the variables, data, and cleaning steps

## How to run

1.  Place the unzipped data folder **UCI HAR Dataset** in your working directory.\
2.  Open and run the `run_analysis.R` script in RStudio (e.g., using **Source**).\
3.  The script will create the file `FinalData.txt` in your working directory.

## Notes

-   The script assumes the data folder is named exactly **UCI HAR Dataset**.
